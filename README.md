This code is an example of how to implement extreme exhaustion levels for turning points in the forex market. It is a part of a product developed by Forex Robot Easy Team, which can be reviewed and evaluated in detail at [Forex Robot Easy](https://forexroboteasy.com/forex-robot-review/extreme-exhaustion-levels-review-forex-tool-for-trend-reversal/).

Please note that ForexRobotEasy is not the official developer of this product. We are only providing a sample code that demonstrates how this product works. To find the official developer of this product, please refer to MQL5.

## Expert Initialization Function

The `OnInit()` function is called during the initialization of the expert advisor. In this function, necessary variables and indicators are initialized.

## Expert Deinitialization Function

The `OnDeinit()` function is called during the deinitialization of the expert advisor. It is used to clear any allocated resources and memory.

## Expert Tick Function

The `OnTick()` function is the main function of the expert advisor and is called on each tick of the market. In this function, the following steps are performed:

1. Calculate the price action based on historical data.
2. Calculate the moving averages using a specified period.
3. Calculate the Bollinger Bands.
4. Determine the current market condition based on price action, moving average, upper band, and lower band.
5. Determine if the market is reaching extreme levels of exhaustion.
6. Signal when the market is reaching extreme levels of exhaustion.
7. Display arrows on the chart to visually highlight potential reversal points.

## Calculate Price Action

The `CalculatePriceAction()` function is used to calculate the price action based on historical data. The implementation of this calculation is not provided in the code.

## Calculate Moving Averages

The `CalculateMovingAverage()` function is used to calculate the moving averages using a specified period. The implementation of this calculation is not provided in the code.

## Calculate Bollinger Bands

The `CalculateBollingerBands()` function is used to calculate the Bollinger Bands. The implementation of this calculation is not provided in the code.

## Determine Market Condition

The `DetermineMarketCondition()` function is used to determine the current market condition based on price action, moving average, upper band, and lower band. The implementation of this determination is not provided in the code.

## Determine if the Market is Reaching Extreme Levels of Exhaustion

The `IsExhausted()` function is used to determine if the market is reaching extreme levels of exhaustion. The implementation of this determination is not provided in the code.

## Signal When the Market is Reaching Extreme Levels of Exhaustion

The `SignalExhaustion()` function is used to signal when the market is reaching extreme levels of exhaustion. The implementation of this signal is not provided in the code.

## Display Arrows on the Chart to Visually Highlight Potential Reversal Points

The `DisplayArrows()` function is used to display arrows on the chart to visually highlight potential reversal points. The implementation of this display is not provided in the code.

Please note that the actual implementation of the calculations and signals is not provided in this code. It is a sample code provided to demonstrate the structure and flow of the expert advisor. The actual functionality and performance of the product can be evaluated by referring to the official developer through MQL5.
